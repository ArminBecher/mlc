## Getting Started

To install a version of mlc go to the [gitlab releases page](https://gitlab.com/becheran/mlc/-/releases) and download the binaries.

Or use rust's package manager [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to install mlc:

``` bash
cargo install mlc
```

Once you have mlc installed it canned just be called from the commandline:

``` bash
mlc
```

Another example would be to call mlc on a certain dir/file:

``` bash
mlc ./docs
```
